This improved code uses lodash's `debounce` function to limit how often `onBarCodeScanned` is called. This prevents multiple near-simultaneous barcode scan events from overwhelming the application.  It's important to choose a debounce delay that's appropriate for your application's needs.  A shorter delay might allow for slightly faster scanning, while a longer delay might be better for smoother UI updates.

```javascript
import * as ExpoCamera from 'expo-camera';
import { debounce } from 'lodash';

// ... other imports

expoCamera.onBarCodeScannedAsync(debounce(onBarCodeScanned, 250)); // Debounce with 250ms delay

function onBarCodeScanned(scanned){ 
  //simple processing of the scanned data 
  console.log(scanned);
}
```

Remember to install lodash: `expo install lodash`

This debouncing technique effectively manages the rapid succession of barcode scan events, preventing the earlier reported crashes and erratic behavior.  The key is controlling the rate at which the application processes these events.
