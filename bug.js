This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function. The issue arises when the barcode scanner is continuously scanning and multiple barcodes are detected in rapid succession.  The `onBarCodeScanned` function receives multiple barcode data events almost simultaneously. If the app doesn't handle these events properly, it may crash or behave erratically.  The problem stems from the asynchronous nature of the barcode scanning process, coupled with potential race conditions. Consider the scenario where the user moves the camera rapidly across multiple barcodes.  The `onBarCodeScanned` function might receive events for several barcodes before it has a chance to process the previous one.

```javascript
// buggy code in componentDidMount
expoCamera.onBarCodeScannedAsync(onBarCodeScanned);

function onBarCodeScanned(scanned){ 
  //simple processing of the scanned data 
  console.log(scanned)
}
```
